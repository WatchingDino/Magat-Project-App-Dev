                <div class="image main"><img src="images/benefits.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                <h2>Benefits</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any typical web application can run or accessible on any operating system such as the Windows, Mac, Linux as long as the browser is compatible.</li>
                    <li>A web application is usually not required to install in the hard drive of the computer system, thus it eliminates all the issues related to the space limitation.</li>
                    <li>All the users are able to access the same version of the web application, which eliminates all compatibility issues.</li>
                    <li>It also reduces software piracy in subscription-based web applications, for example, SAAS (or Software as a service).</li>
                    <li>They also reduce the expense for end-users, business owners because the maintenance needed by the business is significantly less.</li>
                    <li>Web applications are flexible. A user can work from any geographical location as long as he has a working internet connection.</li>
                    <li>It just takes a moment to create a new user by providing a username, password, and URL, and it's all.</li>
                    <li>After the availability of the cloud, storage space is now virtually unlimited as long as you can afford it.</li>
                    <li>A web application can be programmed to run on a wide variety of operating systems, unlike native applications that can run on a particular platform.</li>
                    <li>Any standard web application is developed with some basic programming languages like HTML, CSS that are compatible and well known among the IT professionals.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="image main"><img src="images/disadvantage.png" alt="" /></div>
                <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Internet connection is necessary to access any web application, and without an internet connection, anyone can't use any of the web applications. It is very typical to get an internet connection in our modern cities, still rural area
                        internet connectivity not so well.</li>
                    <li>Several people in business believe that their data on the cloud environment is no that secure and likes to stick with old methods; they even don't want to use new methods.</li>
                    <li>As we all know that many users like to use different web browsers according to their needs and choices. So while creating a web application, you must remember that your application must support several web browsers, including new and
                        old versions of browsers.</li>
                    <li>Speed-related issues are also affecting the web application's performance because there are several factors on which the performance of a web application depends, and these all factors affect the performance of the web application
                        in their own way.</li>
                    <li>If a user's web application faces any kind of issues, or if he does not have a good quality corporate website, his web application will not be going to run correctly, smoothly.</li>
                    <li>A user must have to spend enough money to maintain the good condition of his web application, provide an update whenever an issue occurs, and make an attractive user interface, which is not so cheap at all.</li>
                    <li>A web application must be programmed/ coded in such a way that it will be run regardless of the device's operating system.</li>
                    <li>A web application may face some issues while running on Windows, Android, or several other operating systems if it is not responsive.</li>
                </ul>
