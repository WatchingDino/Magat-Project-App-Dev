                    <h1>Difference between Native Apps and Web Apps</h1>
                </header>

                <h2>Native apps</h2>
                <p>are installed onto the device itself and are developed especially for a particular operating system. These apps are available on app stores such as Apple App Store, Google Play Store, etc.</p>
                <p>Native apps work in specific operating systems such as Apple iOS, Android or Windows. If an is app made for Android then it will not work on Apple iOS or Windows. We have to build separate apps for each operating system if we want to our
                    app to work across all major operating systems. This means we have to spend more money and more effort (time, resources).</p>

                <h4>Advantages of Native Apps:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Native apps are faster than web apps.</li>
                    <li>Native apps can access system/device resources such as a GPS or camera.</li>
                    <li>These apps can work without an internet connection.</li>
                    <li>These apps have more safety and security than web apps, as native apps must be approved by the App Store.</li>
                    <li>These apps are easier to develop due to the availability of developer tools, interface elements, and SDKs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Disadvantages of Native Apps:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>These apps are more expensive to develop as compared to web apps.</li>
                    <li>Designing and building the app for different platforms such as iOS and Android, is costly and time taking.</li>
                    <li>Maintaining and consistently update of native apps cause more cost.</li>
                    <li>It is difficult to have a native mobile app approved by the App Store.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Web Apps</h2>
                <p>can be accessed through the device's Web browser, Web Apps are based on internet-enabled applications. In order to access we don't need to download and install the app onto a mobile device.</p>
                <p>The app is developed as web pages in HTML and CSS, interactive parts are developed in JavaScript or similar languages. The single web app can be used on most devices capable of surfing the web, it does not depend upon the operating system
                    they use.</p>

                <h4>Advantages of Web Apps:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web apps function in-browser, so we do not need to be installed or downloaded.</li>
                    <li>Web apps are easy to maintain, as they have a common codebase regardless of the operating system.</li>
                    <li>These apps can be set to update themselves or automatically.</li>
                    <li>Web Apps easier and faster to build than native mobile apps.</li>
                    <li>In Web Apps App store approval is not required, so web apps can be launched easily.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Disadvantages of Web Apps:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web Apps do not work without an internet connection.</li>
                    <li>Web apps work slower than mobile apps.</li>
                    <li>It is difficult to discover web apps since they aren't hosted in a specific database like an app store.</li>
                    <li>Web apps have higher risks and poor quality, and there is no guarantee of security since web apps don't need to be approved by the app stores.</li>
                </ul>
