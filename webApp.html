                <h3>Another Definition</h3>
                <p>It is a type of computer program that usually runs with the help of a web browser and also uses many web technologies to perform various tasks on the internet.</p>
                <p>A web application can be developed for several uses, which can be used by anyone like it can be used as an individual or as a whole organization for several reasons.</p>
                <p>In general, a web application can contain online shops (or we can also say them e-commerce shops), webmail's, calculators, social media platforms, etc. There is also some kind of web application that usually requires a special kind of
                    web browser to access them. We cannot access those kinds of web applications by using regular web- browsers. However, most of the web applications available on the internet can be accessed using a standard web browser.</p>
                <p>If we talk about the web application in general, a web application usually uses a combination of the server-side scripts such as PHP, ASP, for handling the information/ data storage and retrieval of the data.</p>
                <p>Some of them also use the client-side scripts such as JavaScript, HTML to represent the data/information in front of the users, and some of the web applications are also using both server-side and client-side at the same time.</p>
                <p>It allows the users to communicate with the organization or companies by using the online form, online forums, shopping carts, content management system, and much more.</p>
                <p>Apart from that web applications also allow its users to create documents, share them, or share the data/ information. By using the web application, users can collaborate on same projects by event when they are not available on the same
                    geographical location.</p>
