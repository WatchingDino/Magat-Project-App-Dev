                    <h1>How does a Web Application works?</h1>
                    <p>In general, web-application does not require downloading them because, as we already discussed, the web application is a computer program that usually resides on the remote server. Any user can access it by using one of the standard
                        web browsers such as Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, etc., and most of them are available free for everyone.</p>
                </header>

                <p>A web application are generally coded using the languages supported by almost every web-browsers such as HTML, JavaScript because these are the languages that rely on the web browsers to render the program executable.</p>
                <p>Some of the web applications are entirely static due to which they not required any processing on the server at all while, on the other hand, some web applications are dynamic and require server-side processing.</p>
                <p>To operate a web application, we usually required a web server (or we can say some space on the web-server for our programs/application's code) to manage the clients' upcoming requests and required an application server.</p>
                <p>The application server performs the task that requested by the clients, which also may need a database to store the information sometimes. Application server technologies range from ASP.NET, ASP, and ColdFusion to PHP and JSP.</p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/web-application-works.png" alt="" /></div>
                <p>A standard web application usually has short development cycles and can be easily developed with a small team of developers. As we all know, most of the currently available web applications on the internet are written using the programming
                    languages such as the HTML (or HyperText Markup Language), CSS( or Cascading Style Sheets), and Javascript that are used in creating front-end interface (Client-side programming).</p>
                <p>To create the web applications script, server-side programming is done by using programming languages such as Java, Python, PHP, and Ruby, etc. Python and Java are the languages that are usually used for server-side programming.</p>
                <h2>The Flow of the Web Application</h2>
                <p>Let's understand how the flow of the typical web application looks like.</p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/webAppFlow.png" alt="" /></div>
                <ol>
                    <li>In general, a user sends a request to the web-server using web browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, etc over the internet.</li>
                    <li>Then, the request is forwarded to the appropriate web application server by the web-server.</li>
                    <li>Web application server performs the requested operations/ tasks like processing the database, querying the databases; produces the result of the requested data.</li>
                    <li>The obtained result is sent to the web-server by the web application server along with the requested data/information or processed data.</li>
                    <li>The web server responds to the user with the requested or processed data/information and provides the result to the user's screen .</li>
                </ol>
